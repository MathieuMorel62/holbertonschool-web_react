## 📝 Description

This project consists of using and configuring Webpack to manage JavaScript resources and modules in the development of web applications. The main objective is to understand the internal operation of Webpack, including dependency management, asset transformation and optimization of output files. This also includes the implementation of development servers, the use of plugins, and the modularization of code to improve the performance and maintainability of the project.

## 📚 Resources

- [Webpack Documentation](https://webpack.js.org)
- [Beginner's guide for Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/)
- [Management of npm dependencies with package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json)
- [Documentation Lodash Debounce](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#debounce)

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools Used

- **Webpack**: Used for the compilation and bundling of JavaScript modules, as well as the management of assets such as CSS and images.
- **Node.js**: Execution environment for server-side JavaScript, used to run Webpack and various npm scripts.
- **Npm**: Package management system for JavaScript, allowing you to install and manage project dependencies.
- **Lodash**: JavaScript library offering utility functions for common programming tasks.

## 📋 Prerequisite

- Node.js version 12.x.x
- npm (package manager for Node.js)

## 🚀 Installation and Configuration

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_react/
```

2. Change the working directory:

```bash
cd Webpack
```

3. Create a package JSON file:

```bash
npm init -y
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run build
```

## 💡 Use

- Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the result of the bundle.
- Use configured npm scripts to test different configurations and development environments.

## ✨ Main Features

1. **Compilation and bundling**: Assembles JavaScript modules and optimizes code for production.
2. **Loading resources**: Integrates managers for CSS, images, and other assets.
3. **Performance optimization**: Divides the code into several bundles to improve loading times.
