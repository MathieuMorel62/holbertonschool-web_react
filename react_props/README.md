# <p align="center">React Props</p>

## üìù Description

The **React Props** project is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of the properties in React, an essential element for the management of data between components. This project allows developers to master the reuse of components and the manipulation of dynamic data within React applications. By focusing on functional components, the project guides through best practices to structure a React application in an efficient and maintainable way.

The heart of the project is based on the application of props to control the behavior of components and their rendering, which is crucial for building interactive and responsive user interfaces. Developers will learn how to define types for props, use fragments to group lists of items, and optimize the performance of loops with keys. These skills are fundamental for any developer looking to excel in modern front-end development with React.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools Used

- **React**: Used to build the user interface with reusable components.
- **PropTypes**: Used to check the types of props passed to the components.
- **Jest**: Used for unit tests of components to ensure their proper functioning.
- **Node.js and npm**: Server environment and package manager to manage project dependencies.

<summary>Source Code Example</summary>
<br>

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}

export default App;
```

</details>

## üöÄ Installation and Configuration

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-web_react/
```

2. Change the directory to `react_props`:

```bash
cd react_props
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## üí° Use

To see the components in action, launch the application and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You will be able to observe different components such as headers, footers, and connection areas, all managing their own props in isolation.

## ‚ú® Main Features

1. **Components with Props**: Demonstration of how to pass data between components.
2. **Validation with PropTypes**: Assurance that components receive appropriate props.
