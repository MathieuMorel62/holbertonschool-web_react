# <p align="center">🌟 React Inline Styling 🌟</p>

## 📝 Description

The **React Inline Styling** project explores online stylization techniques in React applications. This project focuses on the application of style directly in the component, providing increased flexibility in the design of the user interface. It highlights the difference between the use of CSS files and online style, and also introduces the CSS-in-JS tool, **Aphrodite**.

The main objective of this project is to provide an in-depth understanding of style management in React, including the use of conditions to apply different styles, responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes, and the creation of small animations to improve the user experience. This project helps to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces using online stylization techniques.
