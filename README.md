## üìù Description

This repository is dedicated to learning and mastering React, an essential JavaScript library for the development of interactive and modern user interfaces. The project explores various fundamental aspects of React, including components, props, state and life cycle of the components.

It also highlights the integration of TypeScript for static typing, thus improving the robustness and maintainability of the code. Webpack is used for the effective management of modules and assets, allowing the creation of complex and powerful web applications. This project is a valuable resource for developers wishing to deepen their skills in React and modern web development.
