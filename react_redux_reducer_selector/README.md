# <p align="center">üåü React Redux Reducer + Selector üåü</p>

## üìù Description

This project focuses on using Redux to manage the status in a React application. In particular, it explores the creation of reducers and selectors to effectively structure the state and allow optimized access to data. The project is divided into several stages, covering aspects such as the use of Immutable.js to ensure the immutability of the state, and the integration of Normalizr to standardize application data.

The main objectives of this project include the creation of reducers for different entities of the application, the implementation of selectors to access data effectively, and the writing of unit tests to ensure the proper functioning of reducers and selectors. This project is an excellent opportunity to deepen the understanding of advanced state management with Redux in a React environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools Used

- **React**: Used to build the user interface.
- **Redux**: Manages the state of the application in a predictable way.
- **Immutable.js**: Guarantees the immutability of states in reducers.
- **Normalizr**: Facilitates the normalization of complex data.
- **Jest**: Used to write and run unit tests.

npm run test
```

## ‚ú® Main Features

1. **Display of the notification drawer**: Allows you to display or hide the notification drawer according to the user's actions.

2. **User connection**: Manages the user's connection status, from connected to disconnected depending on the successful or failed connection actions.

3. ** Course management**: Loads and updates the list of courses with actions to select or deselect courses.

4. **Management of notifications**: Loads and updates the list of notifications with actions to mark them as read or unread, and to filter the types of notifications.

5. **Use of Immutable.js**: Guarantees the immutability of states for optimal performance.
